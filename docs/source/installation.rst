Installation
============

To install TopOpt, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install topopt

This is the preferred method to install TopOpt, as it will always install
the most recent stable release.

In case you want to install the bleeding-edge version, clone this repo:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/zfergus/topopt.git

and then run

.. code-block:: shell

   cd topopt
   python setup.py install
